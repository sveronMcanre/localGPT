# What is a FULL ECAM trainer and how can it help you learn Airbus A320 systems?
 
A FULL ECAM trainer is a software application that simulates the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor (ECAM) system of the Airbus A320 aircraft. The ECAM system displays information about the aircraft's systems, engines, fuel, electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic, environmental, landing gear, flight controls, and warnings on two screens in the cockpit. The ECAM system also provides procedures and actions for the pilots to follow in case of normal or abnormal situations.

A FULL ECAM trainer can help you learn Airbus A320 systems by allowing you to interact with the ECAM system on your computer or mobile device. You can select different failures and scenarios and see how the ECAM system reacts and guides you through the appropriate steps. You can also practice normal operations and checklists using the ECAM system. A FULL ECAM trainer can help you improve your knowledge, skills, and confidence in operating the Airbus A320 aircraft.
 
There are several FULL ECAM trainers available online for free or for a fee. Some examples are:
